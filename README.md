Amity has rooms which can be offices or living spaces. An office can occupy a maximum of 6 people. A living space can inhabit a maximum of 4 people.

A person to be allocated could be a fellow or staff. Staff cannot be allocated living spaces. Fellows have a choice to choose a living space or not.

This system will be used to automatically allocate spaces to people at random.
